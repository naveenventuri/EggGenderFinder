Heart attacks. Lung disorders.

Or their promotions in any manner.

It's a bad habit that makes you sick.

12
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:33,352
What?

13
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:35,924
Cigarette smoking
is injurious to health.

14
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:39,630
No one smokes in this film.

15
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:43,573

- Me
- You have a baby boy.

33
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:41,856
That's awesome!

34
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:45,350
A girl baby would
have been problematic

35
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:47,986
As they grow in years
you burn with anxiety.

36

Until you get them married.

elopes with someone

When you are old and tottering...

And even ride with free hands...aiyo!

'When you hear me say this

or how beautiful...

149

...she has to finally marry...

150

...the man her family chooses.

151

your uncle when I selected him.

153

But now, see how
happy everyone is?

154
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:47,679
It's always best to
marry the guy we like

155
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,026
Or we have to force
ourselves to like him

156
00:15:55,988 --> 00:16:00,058
'I decided that day
I'd find my own guy'

157

I thought he had
mischievous intentions'

174
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:21,176
'But his behavior
actually stunned me'

175
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,014
Hi Pooja!

176
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:24,287
Hi!

177
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,146
Nice song, isn't it?

00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:40,635
My father is a doctor
and so is yours.

182
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:44,228
I will grow up to
become a doctor too.

183
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,209
You too will become one.

184
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:50,408
I like you.

185
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:53,204
You don't have to say anything now.

186
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:54,775
Think over it and tell me tomorrow.

187
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,787
Okay, see you.

188
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:11,523
Okay!

189
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,415
Hey guys, look at all the fish.

190
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,123
Just watch me now.

191
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:49,095
- Shambu brother no 1
- Get lost.

192
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,369
Shambu brother,
you're really a tiger.

193
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:01,216
What is your problem, man?

194
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:04,242
How dare you accost me?!

195
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:08,191
Do you play with us?

196
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,253
- Now slap her butt
- No, bro

197
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,959
- Come on, slap her
- No, bro

198
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,920
Run off.

199
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:50,400
Sambhu bro's face is broken.

200
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,207
Take me with you, guys.

201
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:27,960
<i>Pooh?</i>

202
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,628
What have you decided?

203
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:35,629
You know, when we meet
the person we like...'

204
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:39,511
'...kind of cool feeling
spreads in your tummy'

205
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,473
What did you say
your name was?

206
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:44,342
Ya...Yardley

207
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:45,743
Ah yes! Yardley

208
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,412
When I see you
I don't get that feeling.

209
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,689
Sorry, okay?

210
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,756
'For the 1st time I met a deadly guy.

211
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,525
I wondered who he was the whole night'

212
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:04,268
'Next day I met him again'

213
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:09,608
- Sweetie, come
- Get lost, man!

214
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:29,020
Step up, man. Go.

215
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:32,456
Hey! -What? -Go.

216
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,994
- Go home, dude
- Sure, we will

217
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:53,045
Fill fuel in it
and bring it home

218
00:21:57,683 --> 00:22:00,117
'For the 1st time
I missed the school bus'

219
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:02,453
'I had no idea when
the school bus came or left'

220
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:04,455
'I just kept thinking of that guy'

221
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:07,024
'Something else happened today'

222
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:09,794
Papa bought me a mobile phone'

223
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:12,997
'Nokia 3310
Superb phone'

224
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,999
'I had told him
I didn't want one'

225
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,072
'But it was useful to someone else!'

226
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,383
Hello?

227
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:25,076
Okay, I'll give it

228
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:25,643
Here

229
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:26,977

00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,517
'This is my other friend, Donna'

233
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,019
'They are my best pals'

234
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,955
Neethu loves 3-4
guys at same time

235
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:40,958
Donna can eat 3-4 pancakes in one go!

'Even while I sat with them

237
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:46,564
my thoughts were on 'that' guy'

238
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:49,033
Why are you sitting
and mooning so?

239
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,801
I'm hungry again

240
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:53,971
Yes! Kanjyani!

disrepute to the family'

'He's an expert in
the vanishing act'

248

'When in trouble
he'll disappear'

249
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,991
'He will appear when
everyone has forgotten'

250
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:17,995
'1st time he vanished
was when...ah! I remember!

00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:21,671
'He was once an altar boy'

00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:42,830

all altar boys usually do'

Adept at taking
money...vagabonds!

It's on Sunday. -Yes. -Don't forget

267
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:28,759
You'd say you are
from Jose brother's house

268
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,660
You'd say.

269
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:31,128
Do you follow?

270
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:31,996
Okay, sir. Will you say that?

271
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:34,732
Okay. Here.

272
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:36,041
Now go.

00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:43,073
- What?
- Religious labor supply

275
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:45,676
The day before Sunday church festival.

276
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:46,744
Our Reverend has ordered...

277
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:48,646
...1 member from each house to

278
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:49,346
take part in the circumambulation

279
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:51,582
Where is the time for our people?

280
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:54,919
So I have arranged a proxy

281
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,121
They will happily go
for the circumambulation

282
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:59,089
Our people will
sleep at home, drunk

283
00:25:59,090 --> 00:25:59,830
How's that?

284
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:06,330
You don't have to carry the cross

285
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:08,165
Muthuraj will go instead of you

286
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:10,009
Just have a few pegs
and sleep at home

287
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:15,773
Why are you here?

288
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:18,943
The other day when a guy came to bus stop...

289
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:20,144
all of you ran away scared

290
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:21,145
Who is that guy?

291
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:22,124
Him...huh?

292
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:26,116
Giri! -Giri!

293
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:27,751
I wasn't scared

294
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,119
He is not a good guy

295
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,155
Typical thug

296
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:48,639
Used to be a communist with...

297
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,085
...an arrogance that accompanies it.

298
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:01,029
He is an enemy to us.

299
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,156
Don't even look him in his face

300
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:04,922
Giri?

301
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:05,923
A thug?

302
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:07,391
Who told you this?

303
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:10,227
He is late comrade Madhavan's son.

304
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:12,230
Graduated from St Thomas

305
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:15,165
Now he is an agriculturist

306
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:16,700
He likes that

307
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:19,770
The other day, fed up with those boys...

308
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:23,040
I asked him to come to the bus stop

309
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:25,180
Why are you asking me all this?

310
00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:28,153
See you, GREY?

311
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:40,024
Giri? Great guy.

312
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:40,991
Gives blows for blows

313
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,159
And respect for respect.

314
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,662
I can go anywhere with him

315
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:45,971
He is a tiger cub

316
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:51,101
We must change
the brake lining.

317
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:53,837
It'll be hundred. No. Thousand bucks

318
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:54,872
That much?

319
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:57,041
Of course. I have to
change everything

320
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:58,282
Okay

321
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:08,986
Lord, may this kid never sell her bike.

322
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:10,830
...and may she always bash it up!

323
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:15,092
Doctor, what shall we do...

324
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:16,393
regarding the committee meeting?

325
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:19,163
No need to worry

326
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:21,131
Just tell Giri
He'll see to it.

327
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:22,110
Okay then
Let me go

328
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,204
I've informed my mother

329
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,306
I don't talk much to girls

330
00:28:29,307 --> 00:28:30,040
I know, Pooja has told me

331
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:33,811
I found out everyone here
knew Giri except me'

332
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:35,112
You mean our Giri?

333
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:36,914
You too know him?

334
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:39,383
<i>He. is a Kung in master. fight'!?</i>

335
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,317
He is master at the academy

336
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:42,093
where my brothers learn Kung-fu

337
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,023
Which academy?
Where is it?

338
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:47,391
2 stuffed pancakes.

339
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:50,839
And a milk shake. I'll take you

340
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:05,008
How can you go
for the tournament?

341
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:07,377
If you do so, they'll bash you.

342
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:09,079
Go and practice well.

343
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:09,421
Okay, master.

344
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:14,026
- What is it?
- I came with her

345
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:19,192
I mean...I came
to see my brothers

346
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,833
Why do you send them here?

347
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:26,363
They are asleep full time.

348
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:28,532
They don't have the energy
to do even a push-up

349
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:31,268
No wonder! It's all because of
the fast foods...

350
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,070
you buy for them.

351
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:36,507
1st reduce their fast giving
only porridge and pulses

352
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:39,076
Then they can learn Kung-fu.

353
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:42,146
'Porridge and pulses'

354
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:44,915
For that people
at home must know to cook

355
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:47,055
Go...get going quickly

356
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:49,386
Come
Escape

357
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:50,287
Don't look back

358
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,355
He is in a bad mood.

359
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:52,456
And with a stick in his hands too!

360
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:53,458
Come. Let's go.

361
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:00,130
My dear most Tomycha!

362
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:02,099
Instead of struggling in
an alien land.

363
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,066
Come to Kerala

364
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:04,868
Will you get this greenery,

365
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:08,071
breeze and sunshine there?

366
00:30:08,072 --> 00:30:11,178
Just mint money in a desert

367
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:14,511
Have you come?

368
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:16,346
Go and shower

369
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:20,090
If you want warmth
you must come to Kerala.

370
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,556
How long will you
keep postponing it?

371
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:28,003
Mom, how do you
make pulse-curry?

372
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:35,403
Forget it
I'll make it

373
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:34,333
Okay, I'll shower
and freshen up

374
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:38,232
Don't you dare to touch it? -No.

375
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:59,216
Cooking must never
be a ritual, my dear

376
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:02,130
Bear in mind
folks must eat it!

377
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:05,656
Whatever you do,
you'd have an aim.

378
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:07,500
You must

379
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:32,683
"Did the breeze hum love's tune?

380
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:36,253
To its melody did the heart awaken?"

381
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:40,157
"Did someone cares your body, parakeet.

382
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:43,193
With feathers of dew drops soft and sweet?"

383
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:46,437
"Did the breeze hum love's tune?

384
00:32:47,198 --> 00:32:50,167
To its melody did the heart awaken?"

385
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:53,737
"Did someone caress your body, parakeet.

386
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:57,185
With feathers of dew drops soft and sweet?"

387
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:07,284
"My dearest bird!"

388
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:07,718
'What is it?'

389
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:11,355
"My dear bird!"

390
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:14,491
"Whom are you searching on paths winding

391
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:18,061
with silver beam of moonlit eyes shining?"

392
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:23,062
"Girl, do your eyelids flute in shyness?"

393
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:27,804
"Soft words of sweet nothings

394
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:31,719
dear! did the night bird whisper in your ear?"

395
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:36,580
"On your lips did dawn arise
tuned as a song?"

396
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:41,581
"Do tears gently flow
when you don't know?"

397
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:48,125
"Within you many a nectarine drop

398
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:52,040
moist and misty will sprinkle nonstop"

399
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:58,111
'Stop there!'

400
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:01,640
'7th Community wedding'

401
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:08,715
"Did the breeze hum love's tune?

402
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:12,315
To its melody did the heart awaken?"

403
00:34:12,316 --> 00:34:15,285
"Did someone caress your body, parakeet,

404
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:19,166
with feathers of dew drops soft and sweet?"

405
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:21,429
'I have reserved it for you'

406
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:26,671
'Enter The Dragon'

407
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:29,800
Let me go.

408
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:31,303
Okay!

409
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:41,617
Get lost, girl!

410
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:50,353
"With letters of your life, name you etched

411
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:53,890
With your fingertips the truth you searched"

412
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:58,891
"Like a cloud of illusion
did someone appear"

413
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:05,231
"Listening eagerly for those love-hr words

414
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:14,621
you eavesdropped from behind doors closed"

415
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:31,228
"Did the breeze hum love's tune?

416
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:34,464

with feathers of dew drops soft and sweet?"

419
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:44,274
Dad told us about my sister.

420
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:46,209
'If Giri had not helped...

421
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:48,212
she'd have joined in the convent'

422
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,282
"Did someone caress your body, parakeet,

423
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:55,821
with feathers of dew drops soft and sweet?"

424
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,172
What are you doing?

425
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:15,475
Wash it. Let me see who it is.

426
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:31,527
'Giri, you?'

427
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:34,357
'Greetings, aunty
Were you busy?'

428
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,593
'Come...why so late?'

429
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:38,461
'They delayed it'

430
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:39,963
'I've told them I'll dump it over

431
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:41,298
their heads if the grapes were spoilt'

432
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:43,433
'Shall we find someone else?'

433
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:44,801
'Do you know any?'

434
00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:45,735
'I'll find out, aunty.

435
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:47,571
I do know a few others'

436
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:48,638
'That will be better'

437
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:49,372
'Good grapes must be

438
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:50,607
used in wine making'

439
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:52,209
'If it's someone you know

440
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:52,976
I can trust him all the more'

441
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:53,743
'I'll let you know'

442
00:36:53,744 --> 00:36:56,713
How is Sumitra?
- She's fine'

443
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:57,347
Shall I take leave?

444
00:36:57,348 --> 00:36:58,915
Sit, have some tea

445
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:00,483
No, I have class
at the academy

446
00:37:00,484 --> 00:37:02,225
Okay. Okay, then.

447
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:27,344
Who was it?
- That was Giri

448
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:29,312
Haven't you met him?
- No

449
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:30,447
He has come here so often

450
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:32,249
Giri is the most favorite student

451
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,284
of my husband, Kung fu Tomyachan

452
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:37,387
He used to come here
with him long ago.

453
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:39,656
Very helpful

454
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:44,294
His mom Sumitra and
I're class mates

455
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:45,061
Poor thing

456
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:48,031
After her husband died,
she has only Giri

457
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:50,273
And he...his mother

458
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:52,736
He could have
continued his studies

459
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:56,673
But he likes being a farmer
and this village life.

460
00:37:56,674 --> 00:37:58,541
I liked his decision

461
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:01,845
Doctors and engineers are
not enough.

462
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:03,985
Don't we need
someone for agriculture?

463
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:07,684
Sumitra used to write poetry

464
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:12,361
That time she fell for
Madhavan and married him

465
00:38:12,923 --> 00:38:14,691
Her family threw her out

466
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:16,399
And stopped
her writings and education

467
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:20,873
And then?

468
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:23,767
She does not write now

469
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:26,069
Giri is very upset about that

470
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:28,838
He says in her efforts to bring him up

471
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:31,107
...her dreams took a back seat.

472
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:34,077
I have seen him crying only once

473
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:36,991
Feeling for his mom. He's pity.

474
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:40,383
He's a nice guy, eh?

475
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:42,786
If my daughter in Dubai, Helen

476
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:44,387
If she had been younger than Giri...

477
00:38:44,388 --> 00:38:45,833
I'd have made her marry him.

478
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:48,995
I was just joking!

479
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:55,098
Our Kanjyani and Giri
were classmates

480
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:57,367
He knows him very well

481
00:38:57,368 --> 00:38:58,608
What? Were they class-mates?

482
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:00,570
He never told me.

483
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:03,017
What? -Nothing.

484
00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:17,387
Hi Sreelakshmi!

485
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:17,889
Hi!

486
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:26,571
Come

487
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:29,866
Look, how is my new business?

488
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,901
Internet is the future

489
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:33,903
The person who first
brought it here

490
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:35,772
David Kanjyani

491
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:36,581
Great

492
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:40,877
Yuck! This is immoral traffic.

493
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:41,711
What traffic?

494
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:42,417
Immoral

495
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:46,049
Poor kids! This is the only
place...

496
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,620
...they can sit together

497
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:50,520
They can use internet
and enjoy privacy

498
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:51,688
And I make money

499
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:53,390
- Yuck!
- Why yuck?

500
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,392
Why are you here?

501
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,126
Want to browse?

502
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:57,460
I don't want to browse

503
00:39:57,461 --> 00:39:59,095
I came to ask you something.

504
00:39:59,096 --> 00:39:59,963
About what?

505
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:03,633
Were you and Giri classmates?

506
00:40:03,634 --> 00:40:05,635
You ask about him from some days.

507
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:07,470
I refuse to talk
Go away! Go!

508
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:08,104
You had better tell me.

509
00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:09,083
Or I'll tell your people about this.

510
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:13,954
I was just joking. Don't get angry.

511
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:17,186
I'll tell you everything

512
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:21,017
I know him from
when I reached puberty.

513
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:21,818
Puberty?

514
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:24,129
Did you think only girls
undergo that...

515
00:40:25,055 --> 00:40:26,956
Can girls alone come to that stage?

516
00:40:26,957 --> 00:40:28,027
We boys too face it
in life, my girl

517
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:31,438
We 3 were thick friends

518
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:40,039
'Giri, that girl and me'

519
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:46,984
'They both were madly in love'

520
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:49,623
'What?
In love?'

521
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:52,127
Great love.

522
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:00,957
And...?

523
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:05,958
Like all girls, she married a well placed

524
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:08,009
guy from USA arranged by her family

525
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:11,601
From then he stopped talking to me

526
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:12,769
But what was your fault?

527
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:13,903
I didn't do anything.

528
00:41:13,904 --> 00:41:14,737
It was my father's fault.

529
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:16,005
Father?

530
00:41:16,006 --> 00:41:18,074
That girl was your American cousin.

531
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:20,521
My twin, Julie Kanjyani.

532
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:29,619
Hey! That cheat!
Julie sister.

533
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,855
Lord! I also ate 2 plates...

534
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:33,122
...of biriyani on her wedding.

535
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:34,924
That day he removed

536
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:37,838
...the pillion seat of his bike

537
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:52,041
Enough of chatting
Now go away

538
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:52,742
Let's meet later on.

539
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:53,653
Okay.

540
00:41:56,113 --> 00:42:00,116
I loved 5 to 6 guys. I say you.

541
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:02,185
A guy will hate all girls...

542
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:04,521
...if he has been ditched by 1.

543
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:07,190
That too by a rich girl

544
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:09,759
Your family also including that rich girl.

545
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,227
All that doesn't matter

546
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:12,673
I will tell him I like him

547
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,998
Will he recognize you? Big doubt.

548
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:17,036
Telling him. How will you tell him?

549
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:19,202
I will tell him

550
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,843
My favorite saint
will show me a way

551
00:42:24,108 --> 00:42:25,178
Won't you, Lord?

552
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:04,814
Do you know to repair cars?

553
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:06,049
Of course I don't.

554
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:08,985
When it stops, we open the bonnet

555
00:43:08,986 --> 00:43:11,091
Do we have to know how to repair?

556
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:17,160
Go out in a rickety old car.

557
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:18,127
...leaving the fine one at home.

558
00:43:18,128 --> 00:43:19,395
You can come after repairing it.

559
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:20,238
I'll walk home.

560
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:29,973
What happened, doctor?

561
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:30,974
Did the car let you down?

562
00:43:30,975 --> 00:43:32,318
Giri...
-u

563
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:35,178
A small problem.

564
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:36,346
I need to call a taxi.

565
00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:38,915
It's only a short drive.

566
00:43:38,916 --> 00:43:40,283
Come, I'll drop you.

567
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:41,592
Thank you.

568
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:46,158
Let me bring my key.

569
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:08,383
What? Aren't you walking home?

570
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:18,087
Where are you coming from?

571
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:21,224
On our way back from Francis
daughter's wedding.

572
00:44:21,225 --> 00:44:23,826
I heard about it.

573
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:25,328
A record dowry
was given, right?

574
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,163
Sure! 200 gold sovereigns.

575
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:29,999
If wealthy people keep
hiking dowry...

576
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,433
Where will it reach?

577
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:32,235
You ought to be ashamed.

578
00:44:32,236 --> 00:44:34,237
Poor families are
the ones affected.

579
00:44:34,238 --> 00:44:36,739
Our Gopal brother has 3 daughters.

580
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:38,474
What will people like him do?

581
00:44:38,475 --> 00:44:42,116
I hate people giving
as well as receiving dowry.

582
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:45,415
As long as people like
you still exist...

583
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:49,252
...to help poor and
conduct community weddings.

584
00:44:49,253 --> 00:44:50,789
Right?

585
00:44:52,956 --> 00:44:55,124
Stop!
stop! I Say

586
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:57,799
Park this way.
Now stop.

587
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,105
What are you carrying?

588
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:02,999
Cow dung.

589
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,100
Cow dung?

590
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:06,377
Take your documents
and show it there.

591
00:45:12,943 --> 00:45:14,143
You refuse to get out, eh?

592
00:45:14,144 --> 00:45:16,045
Are your legs paralyzed?

593
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,814
Who is the sub inspector?

594
00:45:17,815 --> 00:45:18,748
Is it George?

595
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:20,283
You dare address him by name?

596
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:21,262
What is it?

597
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:24,120
Some chap called Giri.

598
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:26,155
He finds it tough to step out.

599
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:29,125
Why do you force them?

600
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:30,127
Ask him to go.

601
00:45:43,107 --> 00:45:44,941
Can I give you
some cow dung?

602
00:45:44,942 --> 00:45:47,422
No, I don't want.

603
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,824
Do you know
that sub-inspector?

604
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:01,190
Yes, during a mild clash...

605
00:46:01,191 --> 00:46:02,492
...when I was once part of
revolutionary activities.

606
00:46:02,493 --> 00:46:05,428
After that both of us
were put inside.

607
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:08,467
He was in ICU
I was in jail.

608
00:46:38,562 --> 00:46:39,905
Papa!

609
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:43,067
How much will you give him,
whom I marry?

610
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:45,501
What sort of question is that?

611
00:46:45,502 --> 00:46:47,170
All our assets belong
to you, isn't it?

612
00:46:47,171 --> 00:46:50,206
I will give him everything
Enough?

613
00:46:50,207 --> 00:46:52,108
You mustn't give
a single rupee.

614
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:55,283
And if anyone insists,
get him married to mom!

615
00:46:59,283 --> 00:47:01,250
Welcome to 'replies'

616
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:02,552
Switch off the TV
and go to bed.

617
00:47:02,553 --> 00:47:04,191
Come, dear.

618
00:47:04,388 --> 00:47:06,334
A letter from Suma of Athani.

619
00:47:06,957 --> 00:47:08,224
How will this work out?

620
00:47:08,225 --> 00:47:12,228
Pooja is rich
and Giri a poor farmer.

621
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:16,265
Have you heard
a doctor marrying a farmer?

622
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:18,534
Fathima from Payyanad has replied.

623
00:47:18,535 --> 00:47:22,905
That girl likes him,
isn't that priority?

624
00:47:22,906 --> 00:47:27,076
Sundaran from Tirur
explains explicitly.

625
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:29,912
What is the use of
Pooja liking him?

626
00:47:29,913 --> 00:47:33,049
Does she even know
where he lives?

627
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:34,851
If Pooja remains quiet...

628
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:38,254
Someone else will fall in love with him.

629
00:47:38,255 --> 00:47:42,458
The song telecast last week
from film 'Spadikam'...

630
00:47:42,459 --> 00:47:47,459
...starring Mohan Lal and
Silk smitha was incomplete.

631
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,434
Please telecast the full song...

632
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:54,437
...in your next episode requests.

633
00:47:54,438 --> 00:47:56,205
- Who was it?
- Sugunan from Kundra.

634
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:58,584
In such situations-

635
00:48:01,578 --> 00:48:05,082
'I was a person
who slept like a log'

636
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:08,184
'But from that day onwards...

637
00:48:08,185 --> 00:48:10,222
Slumber-Goddess totally ignored me'.

638
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:16,461
'I decided to find Girt's house'.

639
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:24,300
Tommy'cha, how many times
I'd tell you?

640
00:48:24,301 --> 00:48:26,302
Why do you struggle
in some alien land?

641
00:48:26,303 --> 00:48:27,236
Come back here.

642
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:32,141
Will you get Kerala's greenery
and warmth there?

643
00:48:32,142 --> 00:48:33,246
Come back here.

644
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:35,077
Tommy'cha! 1 minute.

645
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:36,312
Where are you off to?

646
00:48:36,313 --> 00:48:38,314
Going out to see someone.

647
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:40,349
It is about to rain
Don't go now.

648
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:41,183
That's okay, Papa.

649
00:48:41,184 --> 00:48:42,285
I'll be back before it rains.

650
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:44,553
Listen to me
Don't go now.

651
00:48:44,554 --> 00:48:45,254
I want to go.

652
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:46,598
Don't go now.

653
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:53,696
Why shouldn't I go now?

654
00:48:53,697 --> 00:48:55,540
Didn't I tell you this morning?

655
00:48:58,468 --> 00:48:59,402
Go!

656
00:48:59,403 --> 00:49:02,407
<i>Tommy'cha!
- T aka.</i>

657
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:09,011
Where is Girt's house?

658
00:49:09,012 --> 00:49:10,980
Beyond that field.

659
00:49:10,981 --> 00:49:11,356
Beyond, eh?

660
00:50:01,598 --> 00:50:03,366
You! Why are you here?

661
00:50:03,367 --> 00:50:05,201
I came to see the rain.

662
00:50:05,202 --> 00:50:07,737
Are you a bull frog?
Go home, girl.

663
00:50:07,738 --> 00:50:09,046
Wait a minute.

664
00:50:19,249 --> 00:50:20,421
Go home.

665
00:50:24,388 --> 00:50:27,164
Come to see the rain, my foot!

666
00:50:45,275 --> 00:50:47,209
Annie, who has
gone in?

667
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,451
Your daughter. Then it's okay

668
00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:05,061
"Oh pristine bauhinia, sweet red lotus."

669
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:08,564
'Today, are you decked in loveliness?"

670
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:12,334
"Caresses softly...a song."

671
00:51:12,335 --> 00:51:15,838
"Within the heart a tune hums along"

672
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:19,675
"Deep within stars shining bright."

673
00:51:19,676 --> 00:51:23,446
"Did you gather them from the sky at night?"

674
00:51:23,447 --> 00:51:25,381
"Did you utter words never spoken earlier?"

675
00:51:25,382 --> 00:51:30,382
"Did you sing a song never heard before,
dear?"

676
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:34,223
"Oh bauhinia, as red lotus you are born."

677
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:38,260
"Did you swing as dew drops this dawn?"

678
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:45,440
"Has no one gifted a kiss
in your honey lips?"

679
00:52:00,317 --> 00:52:03,853
"Parasol, woven with leaves, hides the face..."

680
00:52:03,854 --> 00:52:08,854
"...of a moonbeam where shyness sways"

681
00:52:11,595 --> 00:52:16,595
"White doves flutter here and there."

682
00:52:16,933 --> 00:52:21,933
"Dreams born in their soul's center"

683
00:52:22,339 --> 00:52:26,219
"Rain drops falling pitter patter, like music..."

684
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:29,512
"...to the ears from anklets which tinkle
magic"

685
00:52:29,513 --> 00:52:38,524
"Loving words of moonlight milky
melt anyone."

686
00:52:40,557 --> 00:52:44,360
"Oh bauhinia, as red lotus you are born."

687
00:52:44,361 --> 00:52:48,364
"Did you swing as dew drops this dawn?"

688
00:52:48,365 --> 00:52:53,365
"Has no one gifted a kiss
in your honey lips?"

689
00:52:55,672 --> 00:53:03,352
"As a gift..."

690
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:10,419
"Oh pristine bauhinia, sweet red lotus."

691
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:14,256
'Today, are you decked in loveliness?"

692
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:17,860
"Caresses softly...a song..."

693
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:21,463
"Within the heart a tune hums along"

694
00:53:21,464 --> 00:53:25,334
"Deep within stars shining bright."

695
00:53:25,335 --> 00:53:28,904
"Did you gather them from the sky?"

696
00:53:28,905 --> 00:53:30,906
"Did you utter words never spoken earlier?

697
00:53:30,907 --> 00:53:35,907
"Did you sing a song never heard before,
dear?"

698
00:53:36,313 --> 00:53:39,648
"Oh bauhinia, as red lotus you are born."

699
00:53:39,649 --> 00:53:43,786
Did you swing as dew drops this dawn?"

700
00:53:43,787 --> 00:53:48,787
"Has no one gifted a kiss
in honey lips?"

701
00:53:51,027 --> 00:53:56,027
"Oh bauhinia, as red lotus you are born"

702
00:53:58,602 --> 00:54:02,404
"Oh bauhinia, as red lotus you are born"

703
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:04,851
"Oh bauhinia, as red lotus you are born"

704
00:54:05,976 --> 00:54:07,250
I'll go see.

705
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,400
Very intoxicating.

706
00:54:31,401 --> 00:54:33,402
Any other stuff
gives such a kick?

707
00:54:33,403 --> 00:54:35,471
Love also is intoxicating.

708
00:54:35,472 --> 00:54:36,338
Right, my child?

709
00:54:36,339 --> 00:54:37,409
I don't know.

710
00:54:39,075 --> 00:54:42,911
Pooja, don't think I'm advising.

711
00:54:42,912 --> 00:54:45,825
Giri is a great guy.
But you...?

712
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:49,518
At this age, it's natural
to get attracted.

713
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:51,720
But you may find out, too late...

714
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:53,322
...your feelings aren't the lasting kind.

715
00:54:53,323 --> 00:54:55,357
Immature feelings-

716
00:54:55,358 --> 00:54:56,759
Forgetting the man she loved...

717
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:59,862
...and accepting a strange bald guy...

718
00:54:59,863 --> 00:55:01,764
...whom she shared tea for just 2 minutes.

719
00:55:01,765 --> 00:55:03,335
Even Julie sister is
elder than me.

720
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:05,869
Is that what
you call maturity?

721
00:55:07,737 --> 00:55:08,904
I don't know.

722
00:55:08,905 --> 00:55:11,106
But I know my parents
like Giri a lot.

723
00:55:11,107 --> 00:55:12,950
You also like him, don't you?

724
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:17,713
You told me once to
find the person I liked.

725
00:55:17,714 --> 00:55:18,385
And now?

726
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:31,761
Does Giri know this?

727
00:55:33,096 --> 00:55:34,330
Have you told him?

728
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:35,397
No.

729
00:55:35,398 --> 00:55:38,379
But I will,
when I get a chance.

730
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:42,438
Do you know what is
special this Sunday?

731
00:55:42,439 --> 00:55:43,739
It's Oshana Sunday.

732
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:45,374
That is for us Christians.

733
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:47,109
Hindus and don't celebrate Oshana.

734
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:49,645
It is his birthday.

735
00:55:49,646 --> 00:55:52,092
He will go by himself
to a special place.

736
00:55:56,619 --> 00:56:00,431
'It was a month after Hrithik Roshan's film
entry.'

737
00:57:29,212 --> 00:57:31,947
Lord...ooops! Sorry.

738
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:33,484
Lord Shiva!

739
00:57:37,854 --> 00:57:39,492
I can't figure out the deity.

740
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:41,557
Whoever it is.

741
00:57:41,558 --> 00:57:43,225
This is my 1st visit to a temple.

742
00:57:43,226 --> 00:57:44,534
Please don't think ill of me.

743
00:57:45,995 --> 00:57:47,796
Om Shanti!

744
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:50,937
Isn't that how it is said?

745
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:00,108
Give him, what he wants.

746
00:58:00,109 --> 00:58:04,216
And then give him to me.

747
00:58:08,518 --> 00:58:09,622
Why are you here?

748
00:58:14,023 --> 00:58:16,902
Why do you come here on your birthday?

749
00:58:25,935 --> 00:58:28,837
This was a place to worship my forefathers.

750
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:30,806
When it was converted as a forest reserve...

751
00:58:30,807 --> 00:58:31,874
...thick bushes covered up the entire area.

752
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:35,982
Dad used to come secretly, when
he was in party.

753
00:58:36,946 --> 00:58:38,721
He used to bring me here as a kid.

754
00:58:40,283 --> 00:58:42,524
It gives me pleasure to
be here on my birthday.

755
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:01,147
Have you brought an umbrella?

756
00:59:02,238 --> 00:59:03,546
Why?

757
00:59:08,845 --> 00:59:10,012
Come.

758
00:59:10,013 --> 00:59:15,013
It always rains 1st on hill.
Did you know?

759
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:46,949
Look here. No.

760
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:48,361
Don't say anything.

761
00:59:49,218 --> 00:59:51,357
I can guess what
you are about to say.

762
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:56,597
A young girl's emotion
towards an older man.

763
00:59:57,860 --> 00:59:59,328
You want to blow it.

764
00:59:59,329 --> 01:00:01,897
One day you'll find it is not
worthy...

765
01:00:01,898 --> 01:00:03,265
and that could be upsetting.

766
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:05,834
Now is the time to study.

767
01:00:05,835 --> 01:00:08,236
To become a great doctor than your dad.

768
01:00:08,237 --> 01:00:10,774
Or destined to reach
greater heights.

769
01:00:12,308 --> 01:00:14,288
Rid your mind
of other thoughts.

770
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:28,290
The rain has stopped.

771
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:29,324
I'll drop you back at home.

772
01:00:29,325 --> 01:00:31,669
No need.
I have my bike.

773
01:02:07,323 --> 01:02:11,059
'When he said that
I was upset'.

774
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,894
'He called me a kid'.

775
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:14,329
'He doesn't know the time...'

776
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:16,031
'I spent to take a decision'

777
01:02:16,032 --> 01:02:18,100
'I don't like him'

778
01:02:18,101 --> 01:02:20,103
'Small kid, eh?!'

779
01:02:23,272 --> 01:02:27,309
'When I turn 18,
I'll tell him again'

780
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:29,311
'That was when the medical...'

781
01:02:29,312 --> 01:02:30,846
'...entrance exams came up'

782
01:02:30,847 --> 01:02:31,947
'And entrance coaching guru...'

783
01:02:31,948 --> 01:02:33,515
'A terror called KC Thomas'

784
01:02:33,516 --> 01:02:36,122
Entrance is war.

785
01:03:05,314 --> 01:03:06,481
You...!
Get out.

786
01:03:06,482 --> 01:03:08,850
I don't want 'entrance'.

787
01:03:08,851 --> 01:03:11,219
Wait. -Leave me.

788
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:13,355
I'll be a good girl.

789
01:03:13,356 --> 01:03:15,157
Let me go home.

790
01:03:15,158 --> 01:03:16,558
Leave me.

791
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:18,927
'5-6 months of torture ended.'

792
01:03:18,928 --> 01:03:21,329
'I wrote my exams splendidly'

793
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:22,197
'To recover from it.'

794
01:03:22,198 --> 01:03:24,940
'I slept like
a buffalo a whole day and night'

795
01:03:37,213 --> 01:03:39,381
'My result came after a month.'

796
01:03:39,382 --> 01:03:41,583
'I got admission in the Kozhikode
medical college'

797
01:03:41,584 --> 01:03:44,019
and I turned 18 too.'

798
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:46,054
'A phase, when my whole
life will turn over'

799
01:03:46,055 --> 01:03:47,856
'But one thing
remained unchanged'

800
01:03:47,857 --> 01:03:49,894
'Giri, my first love'

801
01:03:57,533 --> 01:04:01,970
'Before I left for Kozhikode
I wanted to meet him'

802
01:04:01,971 --> 01:04:03,305
'Wherever I went...'

803
01:04:03,306 --> 01:04:05,340
'how great doctor I may become...'

804
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:07,218
'I'll come to him only finally.'

805
01:04:15,084 --> 01:04:15,951
Hello, who is this?

806
01:04:15,952 --> 01:04:16,896
The little doctor, eh?

807
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:22,057
Rachel told you got through
your entrance.

808
01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:23,124
When are you leaving?

809
01:04:23,125 --> 01:04:24,893
Classes begin
day after tomorrow.

810
01:04:24,894 --> 01:04:25,929
I must leave tomorrow.

811
01:04:27,263 --> 01:04:28,241
- Where is Giri?

812
01:04:29,131 --> 01:04:31,008
- He went to the temple.

813
01:04:32,101 --> 01:04:33,301
'You've gone, without me...'

814
01:04:33,302 --> 01:04:34,610
'...to get wet in the rain, eh?!'

815
01:04:37,073 --> 01:04:37,973
When will he return?

816
01:04:37,974 --> 01:04:40,475
Oh! He didn't go to a local temple.

817
01:04:40,476 --> 01:04:42,478
He has gone to
a temple in China

818
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:47,315
'Lord! Is he turning
to communism again?'

819
01:04:47,316 --> 01:04:48,624
'He went to a temple in China.'

820
01:04:49,652 --> 01:04:51,319
Which temple in China?

821
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:54,522
It isn't a temple for prayers.

822
01:04:54,523 --> 01:04:58,393
<i>It's a place for learning Kung fu.</i>

823
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:00,295
Kung fu temple?

824
01:05:00,296 --> 01:05:01,363
You mean Shaolin Temple?

825
01:05:01,364 --> 01:05:02,206
Yes! Exactly.

826
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:06,468
He has been wanting
to go for long.

827
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:09,075
He did get some scholarship.

828
01:05:10,606 --> 01:05:13,308
But did not want to
leave me alone here.

829
01:05:13,309 --> 01:05:16,044
Recently he went to conduct...

830
01:05:16,045 --> 01:05:17,012
...a marriage for his friend.

831
01:05:17,013 --> 01:05:19,653
That turned out
into a world war!

832
01:05:21,017 --> 01:05:22,360
It became a big issue.

833
01:05:23,519 --> 01:05:27,222
The bride's family
got mad at him.

834
01:05:27,223 --> 01:05:29,491
They threatened to kill him.

835
01:05:29,492 --> 01:05:32,360
When thugs started coming here.

836
01:05:32,361 --> 01:05:35,263
I told him to be away for some days.

837
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:39,034
When will he come back?

838
01:05:39,035 --> 01:05:40,635
I don't know, my dear.

839
01:05:40,636 --> 01:05:43,138
Anyway not in the near future.

840
01:05:43,139 --> 01:05:46,341
Even if he is far
I will be at peace.

841
01:05:46,342 --> 01:05:48,686
Why did you come?

842
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:52,247
Nothing. Just like that.

843
01:05:52,248 --> 01:05:54,049
Sit, my dear.

844
01:05:54,050 --> 01:05:55,350
Let me get you a drink.

845
01:05:55,351 --> 01:05:57,385
No, it's okay.
I'll take leave.

846
01:05:57,386 --> 01:05:58,729
Then it is okay.

847
01:06:03,326 --> 01:06:04,659
'So it ended like that'

848
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:08,129

without a word'.

849
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:10,498

01:06:10,499 --> 01:06:14,102

'...keep up with world events...all wasted'

852
01:06:22,678 --> 01:06:25,249

- Okay.

864
01:07:15,331 --> 01:07:16,664
I'm the only one doing this.

865
01:07:16,665 --> 01:07:18,299
The name was just for a punch.

866
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:19,234
Punch, eh?

867
01:07:19,235 --> 01:07:21,336
A few punches and
you'll know...get in.

868
01:07:21,337 --> 01:07:22,670

Wants a punch to his name!

870

903
01:08:53,229 --> 01:08:53,661
What happened?

904
01:08:53,662 --> 01:08:55,296
- Again he's not talking to me.

905
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:57,140
- We'll set that rig ht. Come.

906
01:08:59,568 --> 01:09:01,736
'That was the time
Orkut became popular'

907
01:09:01,737 --> 01:09:04,339
'Thinking he would be on Orkut.'

908
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:06,374
I created an account and searched'.

909
01:09:06,375 --> 01:09:07,475
'When I typed Giri...'

910
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:09,711
'...many other Giris popped out!'

911
01:09:09,712 --> 01:09:12,180
'When they found
I'd visited their profile...'

912
01:09:12,181 --> 01:09:14,482
'...they started sending me
scraps and messages'

913
01:09:14,483 --> 01:09:16,895
'Finally I had to even
delete my account'

914
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:20,221
'Life was totally boring'

915
01:09:20,222 --> 01:09:21,456
'I slogged like a machine...

916
01:09:21,457 --> 01:09:23,494
...between classes and house'

917
01:09:37,873 --> 01:09:40,475
'We were just thinking life was a waste...'

918
01:09:40,476 --> 01:09:43,711
'...and sitting bored, when it happened'

919
01:09:43,712 --> 01:09:46,581
Let us discuss about different kinds...

920
01:09:46,582 --> 01:09:49,450
...of cardiac arrests or heart attacks.

921
01:09:49,451 --> 01:09:50,429
For example.

922
01:09:56,592 --> 01:09:59,561
'We at first thought
he showed us a demo'

923
01:09:59,562 --> 01:10:01,529
'But it turned out he had actually...'

924
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:03,942
'...suffered a heart attack and conked off'

925
01:10:06,769 --> 01:10:08,403
'After that was condolence...

926
01:10:08,404 --> 01:10:10,611
'...wreaths, funeral and a holiday'

927
01:10:13,509 --> 01:10:15,887
The film 'Classmates' was released.

928
01:10:18,847 --> 01:10:21,851
'And a fantastic new lecturer arrived'

929
01:10:26,855 --> 01:10:30,258
"You are the moonlight of my heart!"

930
01:10:30,259 --> 01:10:32,560
"Musician who stands apart"

931
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:35,463
"Don't you want this perfume?"

932
01:10:35,464 --> 01:10:41,278
"...new made from jasmine specially for you?"

933
01:10:43,539 --> 01:10:46,841
"You are the moonlight of my heart."

934
01:10:46,842 --> 01:10:49,510
"Musician who stands apart"

935
01:10:49,511 --> 01:10:52,480
"Don't you want this perfume?"

936
01:10:52,481 --> 01:10:57,481
"...new made from jasmine specially for you?"

937
01:10:57,987 --> 01:11:00,955
"Don't you want this perfume?"

938
01:11:00,956 --> 01:11:03,324
'Dr Prasad Varkey!'

939
01:11:03,325 --> 01:11:04,892
'Taught us so well'

940
01:11:04,893 --> 01:11:08,329
'Simple soul and
we all loved him'

941
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:10,531
'Especially the girls'

942
01:11:10,532 --> 01:11:13,034
We can discuss this in detail.

943
01:11:13,035 --> 01:11:15,370
But before that, any doubts?

944
01:11:15,371 --> 01:11:17,005
Sir, are you married?

945
01:11:17,006 --> 01:11:21,421
Hmmm...any other doubts?

946
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:23,645
'After 2 weeks...'

947
01:11:23,646 --> 01:11:25,353
'Our viva exams also got started. '

948
01:11:33,489 --> 01:11:34,490
Oh mother!

949
01:11:35,658 --> 01:11:36,329
Take one.

950
01:11:39,628 --> 01:11:40,361
What is it?

951
01:11:40,362 --> 01:11:43,364
Bone marrow
Aspiration needle.

952
01:11:43,365 --> 01:11:45,466
Sir, you want to
ask her something?

953
01:11:45,467 --> 01:11:49,973
Yeah. What do you know about...

954
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:53,508
- Thank you, sir
- Good luck.

955
01:11:53,509 --> 01:11:55,716
Most of them
are quite studious.

956
01:11:56,879 --> 01:11:58,046
Good afternoon, sir.

957
01:11:58,047 --> 01:11:59,480
Good afternoon.

958
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:00,323
Take one.

959
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:05,464
No, it's okay, sir.

960
01:12:06,722 --> 01:12:08,923
Take one. Or
how do we proceed?

961
01:12:08,924 --> 01:12:11,526
No, sir
No, thank you.

962
01:12:11,527 --> 01:12:14,562
If you don't take it,
VIVA can't continue.

963
01:12:14,563 --> 01:12:15,363
Take one.

964
01:12:15,364 --> 01:12:16,069
Take it.

965
01:12:27,910 --> 01:12:29,677
I asked you to pick
one of the instruments.

966
01:12:29,678 --> 01:12:30,778
Why did you
take the biscuit?!

967
01:12:30,779 --> 01:12:34,482
I misunderstood, sorry.

968
01:12:34,483 --> 01:12:36,827
'From then on
we became great friends'

969
01:13:28,804 --> 01:13:31,205
Going by her words
it can only be that.

970
01:13:31,206 --> 01:13:32,840
What?

971
01:13:32,841 --> 01:13:34,542
Dr Prasad Varkey!

972
01:13:34,543 --> 01:13:36,177
She thinks he is
in love with you.

973
01:13:36,178 --> 01:13:37,478
Get lost, girl.

974
01:13:37,479 --> 01:13:39,046
He and I are good friends.

975
01:13:39,047 --> 01:13:41,789
Only good friends
become good lovers.

976
01:13:43,152 --> 01:13:45,620
His glances, conversation and smiles.

977
01:13:45,621 --> 01:13:47,931
Rewind those
and see in a close up.

978
01:13:55,731 --> 01:13:57,039
Throbbing with love, isn't he?

979
01:13:58,534 --> 01:14:00,968
Lord! What a mess!

980
01:14:00,969 --> 01:14:03,538
What's so messy?
Isn't it a good thing?

981
01:14:03,539 --> 01:14:05,206
From America, a fantastic...

982
01:14:05,207 --> 01:14:07,041
...well qualified young doctor...

983
01:14:07,042 --> 01:14:08,176
Moreover a Christian.

984
01:14:08,177 --> 01:14:09,850
I would have blindly
nodded my head.

985
01:14:13,882 --> 01:14:17,518
Still thinking of
your Kung fu guy in China?

986
01:14:17,519 --> 01:14:19,821
The rarest love-affair in the world!

987
01:14:19,822 --> 01:14:21,222
Imagine! A girl goes to him...

988
01:14:21,223 --> 01:14:23,024
...and he says she's still a kid.

989
01:14:23,025 --> 01:14:24,625
You were old enough to have...

990
01:14:24,626 --> 01:14:26,961
...a kid if he had set his mind on it.

991
01:14:26,962 --> 01:14:27,795
Foolish fellow!

992
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:29,630
An umbrella made of leaves as gift.

993
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:31,632
And that too, nothing
to show off about.

994
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:34,702
He must have a wife and
4 kids in China by now.

995
01:14:34,703 --> 01:14:37,605
"A girl waiting only for you."

996
01:14:37,606 --> 01:14:40,212
"For a long, long time"

997
01:14:58,227 --> 01:15:00,764
'Come to bed, my dear man'

998
01:15:04,199 --> 01:15:07,235
'I am working ideas for new Kung fu steps'

999
01:15:07,236 --> 01:15:08,970
'You always wanted a daughter.

1000
01:15:08,971 --> 01:15:10,951
I can't make that happen by myself'

1001
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:16,216
'Oh! Okay
I'll come'

1002
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:28,990
What is it, my girl?!

1003
01:15:28,991 --> 01:15:29,824
Did you have a heart attack?

1004
01:15:29,825 --> 01:15:31,099
- No! A revelation.

1005
01:15:35,764 --> 01:15:37,832
Spoilt my sleep as well!

1006
01:15:37,833 --> 01:15:40,201
'Next day was Diwali'

1007
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:42,203
'I was walking with a heavy heart...'

1008
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:45,606
'...thinking Giri was married, when...'

1009
01:15:45,607 --> 01:15:48,576
'I saw Prasad Varkey
walking towards me'

1010
01:15:48,577 --> 01:15:51,846
'Was he coming to
propose me?'

1011
01:15:51,847 --> 01:15:55,149
'St Antony! Please save me'

1012
01:15:55,150 --> 01:15:57,027
'I prayed and
just then I saw-'

1013
01:16:49,338 --> 01:16:50,817
Why are you here?

1014
01:16:52,074 --> 01:16:55,283
I study here
House surgeon.

1015
01:16:57,312 --> 01:16:59,981
Why are you here?

1016
01:16:59,982 --> 01:17:02,383
I came to meet someone.

1017
01:17:02,384 --> 01:17:03,954
Which is Dr Varma's room?

1018
01:17:04,953 --> 01:17:05,753
Upstairs.

1019
01:17:05,754 --> 01:17:07,825
Okay, see you.

1020
01:17:12,094 --> 01:17:14,301
Pooja!
Who was that?

1021
01:17:16,331 --> 01:17:18,072
Doctor, I must
tell you something.

1022
01:17:21,703 --> 01:17:24,839
He was the 1st person
in my life I liked.

1023
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:27,108
I liked him immensely.

1024
01:17:27,109 --> 01:17:28,247
I'm still in love with him.

1025
01:17:29,277 --> 01:17:30,177
Then, what's your problem?

1026
01:17:30,178 --> 01:17:31,912
He doesn't like me.

1027
01:17:31,913 --> 01:17:33,381
Did he say so?

1028
01:17:33,382 --> 01:17:35,349
Not exactly.

1029
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:37,218
But when I professed my feelings...

1030
01:17:37,219 --> 01:17:38,019
...he told me I was still a kid.

1031
01:17:38,020 --> 01:17:39,854
But that was then.

1032
01:17:39,855 --> 01:17:40,254
Now you are grown.

1033
01:17:40,255 --> 01:17:41,255
Tell him now.

1034
01:17:41,256 --> 01:17:44,792
- It is of no use.
- Why?

1035
01:17:44,793 --> 01:17:46,961
He was jilted
by a girl once.

1036
01:17:46,962 --> 01:17:49,196
I think he loves her even now.

1037
01:17:49,197 --> 01:17:52,733
Look, I am not
able to eat this.

1038
01:17:52,734 --> 01:17:54,771
Why don't we sit and talk?

1039
01:18:05,714 --> 01:18:08,661
Lost love.

1040
01:18:12,154 --> 01:18:13,721
Have you ever
smoked dope?

1041
01:18:13,722 --> 01:18:14,355
Dope?

1042
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:16,390
I haven't either.

1043
01:18:16,391 --> 01:18:20,227
But lost love is
described in 3 stages.

1044
01:18:20,228 --> 01:18:21,969
The 1st stage is like dope.

1045
01:18:22,230 --> 01:18:24,265
Every puff warns you.

1046
01:18:24,266 --> 01:18:25,433
That it's not good.

1047
01:18:25,434 --> 01:18:27,868
Stop, since it's bad for health.

1048
01:18:27,869 --> 01:18:30,137
Lost love is also like that.

1049
01:18:30,138 --> 01:18:32,373
One wants to forget.

1050
01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:35,787
But its kick won't allow you to.

1051
01:18:38,313 --> 01:18:42,750
I'd have got
the unshelled ones.

1052
01:18:42,751 --> 01:18:46,320
The next stage is
like a house rented.

1053
01:18:46,321 --> 01:18:48,756
We go looking in Orkut for her.

1054
01:18:48,757 --> 01:18:51,425
...and her latest lover's details.

1055
01:18:51,426 --> 01:18:53,060
Just like a house owner.

1056
01:18:53,061 --> 01:18:54,699
...keeps tabs on his house.

1057
01:18:57,032 --> 01:18:59,734
The last stage is
like the mustache.

1058
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:00,839
Mustache?

1059
01:19:02,003 --> 01:19:03,983
You can either grow it
Or shave it off.

1060
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:06,474
He does not have one now.

1061
01:19:06,475 --> 01:19:08,409
Probably forgotten his old love.

1062
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:10,014
Pick up courage
Go and tell him.

1063
01:19:16,318 --> 01:19:18,052
I am telling you.

1064
01:19:18,053 --> 01:19:19,157
Just go.

1065
01:19:23,325 --> 01:19:26,393
'I found out all men
are not the same'

1066
01:19:26,394 --> 01:19:29,463
'There were some who...

1067
01:19:29,464 --> 01:19:30,909
...treated you like a friend'

1068
01:19:32,868 --> 01:19:34,835
'I had not asked Giri...

1069
01:19:34,836 --> 01:19:36,036
why he came that day'

1070
01:19:36,037 --> 01:19:38,339
'I went looking for Dr Varma'

1071
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:40,307
'And was a regular
visitor to B-wing'

1072
01:19:40,308 --> 01:19:43,811
'That was when #106
got a new patient'.

1073
01:19:43,812 --> 01:19:45,155
'A jolly good fellow'

1074
01:19:55,423 --> 01:19:57,892
Tharakan, my friend?!

1075
01:19:57,893 --> 01:20:00,261
Here comes
chatterbox Mariam.

1076
01:20:00,262 --> 01:20:02,263
Why so thoughtful?

1077
01:20:02,264 --> 01:20:04,999
I was thinking of writing...

1078
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,400
...a story based on diseases.

1079
01:20:06,401 --> 01:20:08,502
What story can diseases have?

1080
01:20:08,503 --> 01:20:11,305
Diseases are like siblings.

1081
01:20:11,306 --> 01:20:14,344
If one sulks,
others come to inquire.

1082
01:20:15,377 --> 01:20:16,577
I just got over gas trouble.

1083
01:20:16,578 --> 01:20:20,915
...and his brother comes inquiring.

1084
01:20:20,916 --> 01:20:21,282
Who?

1085
01:20:21,283 --> 01:20:22,455
Kidney stone.

1086
01:20:24,286 --> 01:20:26,487
You'd think
it was a diamond.

1087
01:20:26,488 --> 01:20:28,022
Jacob sir.

1088
01:20:28,023 --> 01:20:29,127
Come.

1089
01:20:30,292 --> 01:20:31,826
I've been discharged today.

1090
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:33,961
If I say we'll meet again...

1091
01:20:33,962 --> 01:20:37,231
...hopefully not as patients!

1092
01:20:37,232 --> 01:20:38,399
So I'm not saying so.

1093
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,267
Live well. -Okay, sir.

1094
01:20:40,268 --> 01:20:42,269
Let's leave.

1095
01:20:42,270 --> 01:20:44,011
Come. Let's go.

1096
01:20:46,575 --> 01:20:50,311
3 sons, but when illness struck him...

1097
01:20:50,312 --> 01:20:52,146
...only this daughter took care of him.

1098
01:20:52,147 --> 01:20:54,114
His sons are very busy.

1099
01:20:54,115 --> 01:20:56,650
'He was just like my papa.'

1100
01:20:56,651 --> 01:20:58,892
'And we became friends quickly'

1101
01:21:09,564 --> 01:21:11,031
You minx!

1102
01:21:11,032 --> 01:21:14,946
'It became my habit to
visit him often.'

1103
01:21:19,574 --> 01:21:22,309
Once when I visited 106...

1104
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:25,314
I saw this sight in 107.

1105
01:21:34,689 --> 01:21:36,023
Oh Lord!

1106
01:21:36,024 --> 01:21:37,391
Were you in this wing?

1107
01:21:37,392 --> 01:21:38,336
I didn't know at all.

1108
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:42,429
Rachel told me you were here.

1109
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:45,266
But he insisted
not to trouble anyone.

1110
01:21:45,267 --> 01:21:48,469
Lord! Bilirubin is 10...?

1111
01:21:48,470 --> 01:21:50,170
Jaundice is quite severe.

1112
01:21:50,171 --> 01:21:51,272
Why did you come so late?

1113
01:21:51,273 --> 01:21:53,073
I didn't realize it at all, dear.

1114
01:21:53,074 --> 01:21:56,443
He had a friend here, Dr. Varma.

1115
01:21:56,444 --> 01:21:59,546
I wanted to be nearer home.

1116
01:21:59,547 --> 01:22:03,384
People walk away
to China and Ethiopia!

1117
01:22:03,385 --> 01:22:04,585
Don't worry.

1118
01:22:04,586 --> 01:22:06,253
I'll come and see you everyday.

1119
01:22:06,254 --> 01:22:08,455
I think you can
go home in a week.

1120
01:22:08,456 --> 01:22:09,957
I'll tell the duty doctor.

1121
01:22:09,958 --> 01:22:12,226
As I know you very well.

1122
01:22:12,227 --> 01:22:14,228
Okay, see you.

1123
01:22:14,229 --> 01:22:17,998
'When I saw Girt's mom in hospital...

1124
01:22:17,999 --> 01:22:20,467
...frankly, I was very happy'

1125
01:22:20,468 --> 01:22:23,278
'Weakness for men
is usually their mom'

1126
01:22:23,471 --> 01:22:25,306
'That bed contained the googly...

1127
01:22:25,307 --> 01:22:27,048
Giri could be clean bowled with'

1128
01:23:22,097 --> 01:23:25,299
Chief Doctor says
just 4 days more.

1129
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:26,767
You can take rest
at home after that.

1130
01:23:26,768 --> 01:23:28,135
Okay, little doctor.

1131
01:23:28,136 --> 01:23:29,370
Have you eaten?

1132
01:23:29,371 --> 01:23:31,505
No, we don't get time
in between rounds.

1133
01:23:31,506 --> 01:23:33,774
He was just going out.

1134
01:23:33,775 --> 01:23:35,309
Take her with you.

1135
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:37,449
Bring me back something.

1136
01:23:39,414 --> 01:23:40,518
Mother?

1137
01:23:42,784 --> 01:23:44,318
Thennal?

1138
01:23:44,319 --> 01:23:45,552
How come you are here?

1139
01:23:45,553 --> 01:23:47,755
I am in Providence college.

1140
01:23:47,756 --> 01:23:48,789
As a guest lecturer.

1141
01:23:48,790 --> 01:23:50,224
I am here
for past 1 year.

1142
01:23:50,225 --> 01:23:53,468
This idiot didn't
tell me you're here.

1143
01:24:08,676 --> 01:24:10,811
Enough of eating outside food.

1144
01:24:10,812 --> 01:24:13,447
I cook at home.

1145
01:24:13,448 --> 01:24:14,748
Let me bring you food.

1146
01:24:14,749 --> 01:24:16,695
Come with me now.

1147
01:24:20,655 --> 01:24:22,489
Are you leaving?

1148
01:24:22,490 --> 01:24:23,690
They'll be right back.

1149
01:24:23,691 --> 01:24:24,625
You can go
after eating.

1150
01:24:24,626 --> 01:24:26,427
No, I must complete my rounds.

1151
01:24:26,428 --> 01:24:29,797
'And thus Pooja Mathew's googly...

1152
01:24:29,798 --> 01:24:33,133
...went for a sixer by Thennal Warrier'

1153
01:24:33,134 --> 01:24:35,273
'That was a exciting moment'.

1154
01:24:40,308 --> 01:24:43,510
I found out about her
Thennal K Warrier.

1155
01:24:43,511 --> 01:24:45,491
She was my sister's classmate.

1156
01:24:47,215 --> 01:24:50,417
Nice name
Thennal...breeze.

1157
01:24:50,418 --> 01:24:52,159
Giri means mountain.

1158
01:24:55,323 --> 01:24:57,391
She is a lecturer in Providence.

1159
01:24:57,392 --> 01:24:58,559
And a young-gen budding writer.

1160
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,437
Writer...!

1161
01:25:04,532 --> 01:25:07,301
Look mountain...I mean Giri.

1162
01:25:07,302 --> 01:25:08,838
That thing has come here also.

1163
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:15,309
We can't blame her.

1164
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:17,678
Anyone can wait
5 years for her.

1165
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:20,280
He is smarty.

1166
01:25:20,281 --> 01:25:21,482
Not at all.
He's a shorty!

1167
01:25:21,483 --> 01:25:24,487
Look at his silly smile.

1168
01:25:27,188 --> 01:25:29,896
His shirt is half opened in public.

1169
01:25:33,528 --> 01:25:34,632
Leave it alone, kid.

1170
01:25:37,298 --> 01:25:38,532
What more do you want?

1171
01:25:38,533 --> 01:25:39,500
Mother is an old writer.

1172
01:25:39,501 --> 01:25:40,601
...and lover budding writer.

1173
01:25:40,602 --> 01:25:43,704
He can we read their volumes?

1174
01:25:43,705 --> 01:25:44,771
Why are you feeling jealous?

1175
01:25:44,772 --> 01:25:46,206
They make quite a pair!

1176
01:25:46,207 --> 01:25:46,708
Yes.

1177
01:25:51,246 --> 01:25:52,546
Here! Go boil and eat it.

1178
01:25:52,547 --> 01:25:54,220
What a mean thing!

1179
01:25:58,853 --> 01:26:00,254
'What can I say?'

1180
01:26:00,255 --> 01:26:01,855
'He slipped out of my hands'

1181
01:26:01,856 --> 01:26:03,423
'I went quite mad.'

1182
01:26:03,424 --> 01:26:05,392
'Everything I did was a blunder'

1183
01:26:05,393 --> 01:26:07,532
The wound was in this hand.

1184
01:26:11,933 --> 01:26:15,602
'It was a boulder upon my heart'

1185
01:26:15,603 --> 01:26:17,640
'Every time I saw them together'

1186
01:26:24,245 --> 01:26:25,445
'I even thought of finishing her off.'

1187
01:26:25,446 --> 01:26:28,248
'And be behind bars in Kannur jail'.

1188
01:26:28,249 --> 01:26:30,350
'When I knew it was not working out.'

1189
01:26:30,351 --> 01:26:33,389
'I took a break and went home'

1190
01:26:42,230 --> 01:26:44,540
'Lord! She's here also'

1191
01:26:48,670 --> 01:26:50,411
I too have a book!

1192
01:26:52,774 --> 01:26:56,777
Aren't you Pooja?
I'm Thennal.

1193
01:26:56,778 --> 01:26:59,246
We met a couple of times.

1194
01:26:59,247 --> 01:27:00,647
At the medical college.

1195
01:27:00,648 --> 01:27:02,525
Girt's friend
You want tea?

1196
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:05,485
You want tea
No

1197
01:27:05,486 --> 01:27:07,254
Are you going home?

1198
01:27:07,255 --> 01:27:08,522
Yes.

1199
01:27:08,523 --> 01:27:09,823
Me too.

1200
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:12,395
My husband comes
from Kuwait on leave.

1201
01:27:13,628 --> 01:27:14,661
Are you married?

1202
01:27:14,662 --> 01:27:16,830
I was forced to marry.

1203
01:27:16,831 --> 01:27:17,864
Giri himself made me.

1204
01:27:17,865 --> 01:27:20,267
He came with Robin
to my house.

1205
01:27:20,268 --> 01:27:23,270
It became a big issue.

1206
01:27:23,271 --> 01:27:26,006
Finally Robin
and I came here.

1207
01:27:26,007 --> 01:27:27,941
Giri was forced to
leave his village.

1208
01:27:27,942 --> 01:27:29,683
If he had not
done this for us...!

1209
01:27:32,413 --> 01:27:33,357
Why are you laughing?

1210
01:27:34,682 --> 01:27:35,582
Nothing.

1211
01:27:35,583 --> 01:27:37,529
I knew you both were thick friends.

1212
01:27:37,885 --> 01:27:39,286
2 tea please.

1213
01:27:39,287 --> 01:27:41,028
- Fritters?
- No.

1214
01:27:45,893 --> 01:27:47,861
"Blue sky spread with green
leaves..."

1215
01:27:47,862 --> 01:27:49,529
"...of coconut trees"

1216
01:27:49,530 --> 01:27:52,833
This is a nursery rhyme, isn't it?

1217
01:27:52,834 --> 01:27:55,435
When people become older...

1218
01:27:55,436 --> 01:27:56,503
...they start behaving like kids.

1219
01:27:56,504 --> 01:27:57,671
People say so.

1220
01:27:57,672 --> 01:28:00,674
I've heard when girls grow up...

1221
01:28:00,675 --> 01:28:02,450
...parents' hearts burn with anxiety...

1222
01:28:02,543 --> 01:28:04,386
Do you realize
how old you are?

1223
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:08,393
Sunny was waiting
for you to return.

1224
01:28:08,750 --> 01:28:11,385
I'm into a new venture.

1225
01:28:11,386 --> 01:28:13,662
I am a marriage broker now.

1226
01:28:15,390 --> 01:28:17,591
I want to begin my business
with you.

1227
01:28:17,592 --> 01:28:18,959
There's a nice groom.

1228
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:20,598
Shall I ask him to meet you?

1229
01:28:22,497 --> 01:28:24,477
Asking her
to bride-viewing ritual?

1230
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:26,767
Unthinkable!

1231
01:28:26,768 --> 01:28:29,647
She'll probably go
and 'see the boy'

1232
01:29:14,716 --> 01:29:16,559
Thank you.

1233
01:29:20,521 --> 01:29:21,693
What is your name?

1234
01:29:23,391 --> 01:29:23,857
Giri!

1235
01:29:23,858 --> 01:29:26,099
; 1211;"

1236
01:29:28,796 --> 01:29:30,364
What have you studied?

1237
01:29:30,365 --> 01:29:31,765
Masters in Malayalam.

1238
01:29:31,766 --> 01:29:33,533
What?
I didn't hear you.

1239
01:29:33,534 --> 01:29:35,502
His voice is too soft.

1240
01:29:35,503 --> 01:29:36,982
Say it loudly.

1241
01:29:39,374 --> 01:29:40,444
M.A in Malayalam.

1242
01:29:46,848 --> 01:29:49,649
She may practice
archery and ride a bike.

1243
01:29:49,650 --> 01:29:51,818
Marriage proposal
will make all girls feel shy.

1244
01:29:51,819 --> 01:29:53,560
Did you see her run
shy and demure?

1245
01:30:03,598 --> 01:30:05,999
Sunny said you ran in shyness.

1246
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:09,503
I know my girl
is not like that.

1247
01:30:09,504 --> 01:30:10,537
That's why I ask you.

1248
01:30:10,538 --> 01:30:14,577
Why do you always
avoid marriage topic?

1249
01:30:15,877 --> 01:30:16,743
No reason, papa.

1250
01:30:16,744 --> 01:30:18,745
I'm waiting
for something.

1251
01:30:18,746 --> 01:30:20,180
If it does not happen...

1252
01:30:20,181 --> 01:30:21,047
I'll let you know.

1253
01:30:21,048 --> 01:30:22,649
Then I shall agree
to the boy you suggest.

1254
01:30:22,650 --> 01:30:23,183
Enough?

1255
01:30:23,184 --> 01:30:24,985
Is it some exam?

1256
01:30:24,986 --> 01:30:27,523
Yes, a tough exam.

1257
01:30:28,790 --> 01:30:30,524
<i>1 wrote my “BBS too.</i>

1258
01:30:30,525 --> 01:30:32,505
What exam is this
I'm unaware of?

1259
01:30:33,428 --> 01:30:35,195
Syllabus has changed.

1260
01:30:35,196 --> 01:30:36,106
Times have changed.

1261
01:30:37,532 --> 01:30:40,700
She's a little tigress.

1262
01:30:40,701 --> 01:30:42,203
We'll have to try once more.

1263
01:30:47,842 --> 01:30:50,618
'Next day I attended
an entire sermon Mass'

1264
01:30:52,246 --> 01:30:54,681
'I heard through
Father's boring sermon...'

1265
01:30:54,682 --> 01:30:57,492
'...and was offering
prayers to forefathers'

1266
01:31:05,059 --> 01:31:06,560
<i>Hey! Sukumara Rump'!?</i>

1267
01:31:06,561 --> 01:31:08,094
When did you re-appear?

1268
01:31:08,095 --> 01:31:09,229
2 weeks back.

1269
01:31:09,230 --> 01:31:11,005
Give it to me
I'll light it.

1270
01:31:13,634 --> 01:31:18,515
I am not vanishing
because I want to.

1271
01:31:19,474 --> 01:31:20,907
I tried many ventures.

1272
01:31:20,908 --> 01:31:22,943
Nothing was successful.

1273
01:31:22,944 --> 01:31:25,982
Now something new has come up.

1274
01:31:33,521 --> 01:31:34,654
Okay, now tell me.

1275
01:31:34,655 --> 01:31:38,558
<i>I try to arrange
a Kung fu tournament.</i>

1276
01:31:38,559 --> 01:31:43,559
Jeweler Paul promised to
sponsor it a good amount.

1277
01:31:43,865 --> 01:31:45,932
He's interested
in such things.

1278
01:31:45,933 --> 01:31:47,701
Go ahead.

1279
01:31:47,702 --> 01:31:48,835
What's my role in this?

1280
01:31:48,836 --> 01:31:49,970
He has only 1 condition.

1281
01:31:49,971 --> 01:31:53,039
Giri and his boys must take part.

1282
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:55,075
I know you and
Giri are close.

1283
01:31:55,076 --> 01:31:57,577
Ask him to come with his boys.

1284
01:31:57,578 --> 01:31:59,613
He has trained in China.

1285
01:31:59,614 --> 01:32:01,515
Only if he enters the ring...

1286
01:32:01,516 --> 01:32:02,859
There will be a storm in our village.

1287
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:07,064
Hey!

1288
01:32:08,789 --> 01:32:11,558
Hey!
Somehow. . . ?

1289
01:32:11,559 --> 01:32:13,159
I won't ask him.

1290
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:15,106
You can ask him directly.

1291
01:32:16,197 --> 01:32:19,610
I can't, he's still angry
with me.

1292
01:32:20,134 --> 01:32:22,736
You think he's still thinking Julie's betrayal?

1293
01:32:22,737 --> 01:32:24,204
He must have
forgotten it by now.

1294
01:32:24,205 --> 01:32:25,639
Go and ask him.

1295
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:28,143
Sure! So that he can
chop me to pieces.

1296
01:32:29,810 --> 01:32:32,212
So it's not only
Julie's cheating.

1297
01:32:32,213 --> 01:32:34,159
There's something else.

1298
01:32:36,884 --> 01:32:39,057
How will I explain it to you?

1299
01:32:40,721 --> 01:32:44,191
Think that
Giri and I were in the Army.

1300
01:32:57,638 --> 01:33:00,050
- Captain!
- Give me a hand.

1301
01:33:01,275 --> 01:33:04,279
- Captain, help me
- Careful.

1302
01:33:15,356 --> 01:33:16,266
Water!

1303
01:33:20,027 --> 01:33:20,894
Here.

1304
01:33:20,895 --> 01:33:21,695
What about you?

1305
01:33:21,696 --> 01:33:23,730
You drink it, Lt. Kanjyani

1306
01:33:23,731 --> 01:33:25,301
You are so kind.

1307
01:33:32,173 --> 01:33:33,618
Let's move, captain.

1308
01:33:37,979 --> 01:33:40,880
- Step carefully
- Yes, captain.

1309
01:33:40,881 --> 01:33:43,149
Enemies have buried mines.

1310
01:33:43,150 --> 01:33:44,629
Country fellows!

1311
01:33:54,095 --> 01:33:55,631
Captain...?

1312
01:33:58,899 --> 01:34:00,606
Save me please...please

1313
01:34:01,836 --> 01:34:02,902
Lt. Kanjyani!

1314
01:34:02,903 --> 01:34:04,280
Save me, Captain.

1315
01:34:05,373 --> 01:34:07,284
Don't move.
Stay still.

1316
01:34:08,876 --> 01:34:09,809
Careful.

1317
01:34:09,810 --> 01:34:10,844
Don't be panic.

1318
01:34:10,845 --> 01:34:14,147
Take your foot off.

1319
01:34:14,148 --> 01:34:16,287
Now for the boulder.

1320
01:34:18,052 --> 01:34:23,400
Lt. Kanjyani

1321
01:34:28,029 --> 01:34:29,229
Did you do that?

1322
01:34:29,230 --> 01:34:31,264
Not like that.

1323
01:34:31,265 --> 01:34:32,999
Much worse than that.

1324
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,467
Too shameful to be told.

1325
01:34:34,468 --> 01:34:36,369
It's no use
blaming Giri then.

1326
01:34:36,370 --> 01:34:37,371
Please?

1327
01:34:38,806 --> 01:34:40,376
Let me try talking to him.

1328
01:34:49,083 --> 01:34:50,383
It's not because you requested.

1329
01:34:50,384 --> 01:34:53,263
Not to help him.

1330
01:34:57,725 --> 01:34:59,864
I want my boys to
utilize this chance.

1331
01:35:05,966 --> 01:35:06,706
Go!

1332
01:35:17,278 --> 01:35:18,348
Bring the sack.

1333
01:35:18,412 --> 01:35:20,085
Me?

1334
01:35:32,159 --> 01:35:33,126
I will come.

1335
01:35:33,127 --> 01:35:35,128
I'll be meeting you regarding...

1336
01:35:35,129 --> 01:35:36,196
...donations for the mass wedding scheme.

1337
01:35:36,197 --> 01:35:37,731
Papa doctor and little doctor...

1338
01:35:37,732 --> 01:35:39,332
...had better contribute generously.

1339
01:35:39,333 --> 01:35:42,302
Sure, I'll help in
any way I can.

1340
01:35:42,303 --> 01:35:44,283
I will come for
the next meeting too.

1341
01:35:57,384 --> 01:35:58,351
Where are you off to?

1342
01:35:58,352 --> 01:36:00,987
Community wedding this time will...

1343
01:36:00,988 --> 01:36:02,522
...witness my presence there too.

1344
01:36:02,523 --> 01:36:04,958
Oh! Good!

1345
01:36:04,959 --> 01:36:06,926
It is good to take part...

1346
01:36:06,927 --> 01:36:07,494
...in such social activities.

1347
01:36:07,495 --> 01:36:08,906
I am proud of you.

1348
01:36:10,264 --> 01:36:11,931
Please sign on this cheque.

1349
01:36:11,932 --> 01:36:13,240
I'll write the amount later.

1350
01:36:14,135 --> 01:36:15,135
Isn't this from my account?

1351
01:36:15,136 --> 01:36:18,845
- Yes
- I see.

1352
01:36:21,408 --> 01:36:22,275
Thank you.

1353
01:36:22,276 --> 01:36:24,847
Don't interfere too much, okay?

1354
01:36:30,351 --> 01:36:37,360
"Greenish garden! Lotus flower!"

1355
01:36:51,105 --> 01:36:56,105
"Greenish garden! Lotus flower!"

1356
01:37:06,453 --> 01:37:13,371
"Greenish garden! Lotus flower!"

1357
01:37:16,964 --> 01:37:20,834
'That meeting helped me
get closer to Giri'

1358
01:37:20,835 --> 01:37:21,968
'So when I asked him to come...

1359
01:37:21,969 --> 01:37:23,069
...with me to meet a special person...'

1360
01:37:23,070 --> 01:37:25,209
'...he agreed without
much persuasion'

1361
01:37:46,327 --> 01:37:48,398
Whose house is this?

1362
01:37:48,462 --> 01:37:49,964
Come, I'll tell you.

1363
01:37:58,038 --> 01:38:00,040
Hello! Chatterbox.

1364
01:38:02,343 --> 01:38:03,321
Welcome!

1365
01:38:03,644 --> 01:38:04,918
Come.

1366
01:38:06,046 --> 01:38:07,116
Had a good drive?

1367
01:38:08,549 --> 01:38:10,927
Giri, eh?
I know you.

1368
01:38:12,386 --> 01:38:14,087
You don't have to know me.

1369
01:38:14,088 --> 01:38:15,555
But if you read a lot, maybe...

1370
01:38:15,556 --> 01:38:17,624
...you'd have heard of me.

1371
01:38:17,625 --> 01:38:20,193
Jacob Tharakan
Akshara publications.

1372
01:38:20,194 --> 01:38:21,227
Yes, I have heard.

1373
01:38:21,228 --> 01:38:23,029
I know Pooja for long.

1374
01:38:23,030 --> 01:38:24,931
From her medical college days.

1375
01:38:24,932 --> 01:38:27,166
Don't worry, not as classmates.

1376
01:38:27,167 --> 01:38:29,302
When I get fed up of sleeping here...

1377
01:38:29,303 --> 01:38:31,510
I go sleep there...for treatment.

1378
01:38:35,342 --> 01:38:37,911
Akshara publications will...

1379
01:38:37,912 --> 01:38:39,245
...launch this book this week.

1380
01:38:39,246 --> 01:38:41,351
You can have
the first copy.

1381
01:38:44,084 --> 01:38:45,620
Have a look.

1382
01:38:51,392 --> 01:38:52,029
'In memory of a red flower'

1383
01:39:15,015 --> 01:39:16,549
When I was in hospital...

1384
01:39:16,550 --> 01:39:19,252
She gave me the manuscript.

1385
01:39:19,253 --> 01:39:20,486
When I read it I felt...

1386
01:39:20,487 --> 01:39:22,398
...it was worth publishing.

1387
01:39:22,656 --> 01:39:24,958
She has not influenced me.

1388
01:39:24,959 --> 01:39:26,292
It is really worth it.

1389
01:39:26,293 --> 01:39:29,103
Your mom is a writer to be encouraged.

1390
01:39:32,466 --> 01:39:35,268
Give the first copy to your mom.

1391
01:39:35,269 --> 01:39:36,680
This was her big wish.

1392
01:39:38,272 --> 01:39:41,140
Sumitra will be happy, won't she?

1393
01:39:41,141 --> 01:39:44,418
Or will she put me
in jail for stealing?

1394
01:39:48,015 --> 01:39:49,358
We'll see you.

1395
01:39:51,552 --> 01:39:53,720
This girl is amazing.

1396
01:39:53,721 --> 01:39:56,589
It isn't easy to work towards...

1397
01:39:56,590 --> 01:39:57,790
...realizing someone else's dream.

1398
01:39:57,791 --> 01:40:00,460
The heart must be
full of love for that.

1399
01:40:00,461 --> 01:40:02,095
You are lucky.

1400
01:40:02,096 --> 01:40:04,235
To get a good friend like her.

1401
01:40:04,999 --> 01:40:06,132
Good luck.

1402
01:40:06,133 --> 01:40:07,305
Okay.
Shall we leave?

1403
01:40:23,417 --> 01:40:28,417
"What's happened to me?
I lost my heart indeed"

1404
01:40:33,127 --> 01:40:35,661
"Moments when silence flowed."

1405
01:40:35,662 --> 01:40:37,563
"your eyes I searched, followed"

1406
01:40:37,564 --> 01:40:42,435
"Love entered into my heart you showered"

1407
01:40:42,436 --> 01:40:48,682
"oh you!"

1408
01:40:53,614 --> 01:40:56,182
"Moments when silence flowed."

1409
01:40:56,183 --> 01:40:58,217
"your eyes I searched, followed"

1410
01:40:58,218 --> 01:41:02,822
"Love entered into my heart you showered"

1411
01:41:02,823 --> 01:41:07,135
"oh you!"

1412
01:41:07,795 --> 01:41:11,531
"You are the song my eyes seek."

1413
01:41:11,532 --> 01:41:16,572
"My fingers yearn to strum forever favor"

1414
01:41:17,838 --> 01:41:21,507
"You are the song filling my ear."

1415
01:41:21,508 --> 01:41:26,423
"As my lips sing them dear and clear"

1416
01:41:27,848 --> 01:41:31,451
"When you turn into a shadow"

1417
01:41:31,452 --> 01:41:33,762
"And your eyes like honey mellow"

1418
01:41:36,123 --> 01:41:37,500
'No range'

1419
01:41:38,258 --> 01:41:41,494
"You may be far away"

1420
01:41:41,495 --> 01:41:46,495
"But apple of my eye you stay"

1421
01:41:49,670 --> 01:41:52,438
"Moments when silence flowed."

1422
01:41:52,439 --> 01:41:54,240
"your eyes I searched, followed"

1423
01:41:54,241 --> 01:41:59,241
"Love entered into my heart you showered"

1424
01:41:59,279 --> 01:42:05,195
"oh you!"

1425
01:42:41,889 --> 01:42:44,357
"Oh God! What's happened to me?

1426
01:42:44,358 --> 01:42:46,893
"Lord! I have lost my heart indeed"

1427
01:42:46,894 --> 01:42:48,427
"Oh God! What's happened to me?

1428
01:42:48,428 --> 01:42:50,772
"Lord! I have lost my heart indeed"

1429
01:42:54,801 --> 01:42:55,801
<i>Tommy'chaya!-!</i>

1430
01:42:55,802 --> 01:42:57,470
I am fed up of
telling you again and again.

1431
01:42:57,471 --> 01:42:59,805
Greenery and warmth in Kerala.

1432
01:42:59,806 --> 01:43:01,874
Come and take a look, dude.

1433
01:43:01,875 --> 01:43:03,609
Okay then, get lost.

1434
01:43:03,610 --> 01:43:06,179
Listen dear, Ravi had come.

1435
01:43:06,180 --> 01:43:07,747
Something to do with that list...

1436
01:43:07,748 --> 01:43:10,449
...for the community wedding.

1437
01:43:10,450 --> 01:43:11,417
That is tomorrow's work.

1438
01:43:11,418 --> 01:43:12,752
Tomorrow is another day.

1439
01:43:12,753 --> 01:43:14,426
Today's joys to
be enjoyed today.

1440
01:43:45,519 --> 01:43:47,887
We'd make this
better than last time.

1441
01:43:47,888 --> 01:43:49,222
25 couples this time.

1442
01:43:49,223 --> 01:43:50,690
We must get the minister to...

1443
01:43:50,691 --> 01:43:53,604
...confirm the jewelry sponsorship.

1444
01:43:54,228 --> 01:43:55,229
We'll do that.

1445
01:43:57,564 --> 01:43:58,542
Did you check that list?

1446
01:44:02,569 --> 01:44:05,471
Who is Sreelakshmi's groom?

1447
01:44:05,472 --> 01:44:07,383
That has not been entered.

1448
01:44:07,674 --> 01:44:10,610
I informed the secretary.

1449
01:44:10,611 --> 01:44:13,854
Sreelakshmi will marry my son Giri.

1450
01:44:16,483 --> 01:44:17,783
That is good, Sumithra sister.

1451
01:44:17,784 --> 01:44:18,851
You have a generous heart.

1452
01:44:18,852 --> 01:44:21,487
Please don't say such things...

1453
01:44:21,488 --> 01:44:23,900
...and convert this into charity.

1454
01:44:24,558 --> 01:44:26,459
Sreelakshmi is a good girl and...

1455
01:44:26,460 --> 01:44:28,628
I've known her since she was a kid.

1456
01:44:28,629 --> 01:44:30,267
Giri also.

1457
01:44:31,598 --> 01:44:33,566
She will be perfect for him.

1458
01:44:33,567 --> 01:44:37,003
And you know Giri.

1459
01:44:37,004 --> 01:44:40,606
He hates a wedding
with pomp.

1460
01:44:40,607 --> 01:44:42,416
He will also like this.

1461
01:45:02,663 --> 01:45:12,072
"Oh loved one"

1462
01:45:12,406 --> 01:45:18,322
"Oh loved one"

1463
01:45:21,481 --> 01:45:26,481
"Oh loved one"

1464
01:45:30,457 --> 01:45:35,457
"Oh loved one"

1465
01:45:37,064 --> 01:45:42,064
"There are rainy clouds in the sky."

1466
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:55,560
"My love song has missed its tune."

1467
01:45:56,550 --> 01:46:00,786
"You didn't hear my call."

1468
01:46:00,787 --> 01:46:05,124
"You didn't feel touching my fingers."

1469
01:46:05,125 --> 01:46:08,971
"You're going away from me."

1470
01:46:10,063 --> 01:46:14,433
"I've become alone here."

1471
01:46:14,434 --> 01:46:21,511
"Am I alone in this rain?"

1472
01:46:26,713 --> 01:46:31,713
"Oh loved one"

1473
01:46:44,498 --> 01:46:49,498
"Oh loved one"

1474
01:47:25,772 --> 01:47:27,573
I'll speak to Sumithra.

1475
01:47:27,574 --> 01:47:29,520
Don't be upset.

1476
01:47:30,177 --> 01:47:31,212
No, aunty.

1477
01:47:32,679 --> 01:47:33,987
Girt's mom was rig ht.

1478
01:47:35,215 --> 01:47:37,024
Giri also might
prefer it that way.

1479
01:47:38,485 --> 01:47:39,896
Sreelakshmi is a sweet girl.

1480
01:47:40,954 --> 01:47:44,959
I will never hurt her.

1481
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:49,504
Once I expressed my feelings.

1482
01:47:49,930 --> 01:47:52,433
I can't go and get rejected again.

1483
01:47:54,234 --> 01:47:56,902
If we are to ever unite...

1484
01:47:56,903 --> 01:47:59,543
...he must propose me.

1485
01:48:00,674 --> 01:48:04,554
Frankly I am quite fed up.

1486
01:48:14,988 --> 01:48:17,523
'I was sure that I'd get Giri...'

1487
01:48:17,524 --> 01:48:18,791
'...only through a miracle now'

1488
01:48:18,792 --> 01:48:23,792
'Lord's miracles were my only options'

1489
01:48:24,498 --> 01:48:26,774
'I decided to latch
on to him firmly'

1490
01:48:33,807 --> 01:48:35,650
<i>Denim!</i>

1491
01:48:43,750 --> 01:48:45,525
Can you come out
for a minute?

1492
01:49:01,768 --> 01:49:02,803
Yes, Pooja.

1493
01:49:14,548 --> 01:49:16,982
Forget all the old theories I fed you.

1494
01:49:16,983 --> 01:49:20,786
Everything is fair in war and love.

1495
01:49:20,787 --> 01:49:21,921
Don't consider
anything else.

1496
01:49:21,922 --> 01:49:22,755
We'll cross the bridge.

1497
01:49:22,756 --> 01:49:23,598
Best of luck.

1498
01:49:29,062 --> 01:49:30,097
Take one.

1499
01:49:34,834 --> 01:49:36,108
Now, take one.

1500
01:49:47,147 --> 01:49:48,888
- What happened?
- Listen!

1501
01:49:49,583 --> 01:49:51,584
Shall we ask
Giri to help us?

1502
01:49:51,585 --> 01:49:53,252
How foolish can you be?

1503
01:49:53,253 --> 01:49:54,320
That will not work out.

1504
01:49:54,321 --> 01:49:55,287
Nothing doing!

1505
01:49:55,288 --> 01:49:56,021
You don't have to do anything.

1506
01:49:56,022 --> 01:49:58,298
I'll talk to him, just stand by me.

1507
01:49:58,959 --> 01:50:02,227
This is the only way out.

1508
01:50:02,228 --> 01:50:03,298
Trust me.

1509
01:50:07,934 --> 01:50:09,607
Rahim Rawther's daughter?

1510
01:50:10,737 --> 01:50:12,404
So many Christian girls around and...

1511
01:50:12,405 --> 01:50:14,239
...you chose Rahim Rawther's daughter?

1512
01:50:14,240 --> 01:50:15,378
To fall in love and elope?

1513
01:50:17,377 --> 01:50:20,412
Bro! Help me this time.

1514
01:50:20,413 --> 01:50:22,381
I conducted the tournament and...

1515
01:50:22,382 --> 01:50:23,415
...saved money to marry Naseema.

1516
01:50:23,416 --> 01:50:24,350
Now her marriage takes...

1517
01:50:24,351 --> 01:50:25,694
...place in community wedding.

1518
01:50:28,288 --> 01:50:30,756
We have no option.
but to elope now.

1519
01:50:30,757 --> 01:50:32,930
You must help us.
Please.

1520
01:50:34,160 --> 01:50:36,936
Please.
Help us.

1521
01:50:38,331 --> 01:50:39,999
No, this will
not work out.

1522
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:41,843
Don't expect me
to help you in this.

1523
01:50:42,769 --> 01:50:43,747
Talk to him.

1524
01:50:44,838 --> 01:50:48,974
We thought you'd help
2 people in love.

1525
01:50:48,975 --> 01:50:52,044
You put your own life at stake once...

1526
01:50:52,045 --> 01:50:52,878
...to get 2 of your friends married.

1527
01:50:52,879 --> 01:50:54,313
This is not as bad as that...

1528
01:50:54,314 --> 01:50:55,384
...and I thought you'd help.

1529
01:50:56,716 --> 01:50:58,218
Sorry for asking.

1530
01:51:01,021 --> 01:51:02,054
<i>Denim!</i>

1531
01:51:02,055 --> 01:51:04,189
Naseema was Pooja's classmate.

1532
01:51:04,190 --> 01:51:06,761
She can easily bring her out of house.

1533
01:51:07,260 --> 01:51:10,400
But from there
Giri you must help me.

1534
01:52:11,458 --> 01:52:13,092
Where the heck were you?

1535
01:52:13,093 --> 01:52:15,828
How long to wait!
Come, get in.

1536
01:52:15,829 --> 01:52:17,069
Let's go.

1537
01:52:35,515 --> 01:52:37,517
Just stop there.

1538
01:52:40,787 --> 01:52:42,095
Here.

1539
01:52:43,022 --> 01:52:44,865
Come.
Get down.

1540
01:52:49,929 --> 01:52:52,364
Bro, thanks a lot.

1541
01:52:52,365 --> 01:52:54,533
I'll never forget this favor.

1542
01:52:54,534 --> 01:52:56,241
If fate allows
we'll meet again.

1543
01:52:57,804 --> 01:52:59,408
All I have to say
is in this letter.

1544
01:53:01,074 --> 01:53:02,382
I take leave.

1545
01:53:05,845 --> 01:53:06,949
Okay.

1546
01:53:20,894 --> 01:53:24,196
'Giri, you rogue, shameless fellow!'

1547
01:53:24,197 --> 01:53:26,198
'I used to stand
in bus stops to meet her'

1548
01:53:26,199 --> 01:53:27,833
'You used to chase me away
saying I was a flirt'

1549
01:53:27,834 --> 01:53:29,301
'When I set up the internet cafe..."

1550
01:53:29,302 --> 01:53:30,269
"To meet her alone...'

1551
01:53:30,270 --> 01:53:32,271
'...you showed me to police for immoral
activity'

1552
01:53:32,272 --> 01:53:34,106
'I struggled, made some money...

1553
01:53:34,107 --> 01:53:37,376
...and decided to marry her'

1554
01:53:37,377 --> 01:53:39,411
'Under the community marriages...'

1555
01:53:39,412 --> 01:53:40,512
'...you decided to marry her'

1556
01:53:40,513 --> 01:53:43,148
'Do you think
you are a do-gooder?'

1557
01:53:43,149 --> 01:53:43,916
'Like emperor Ashoka?'

1558
01:53:43,917 --> 01:53:45,317
'I won't allow it'

1559
01:53:45,318 --> 01:53:46,524
'I won't give up
my girl for you'

1560
01:53:50,924 --> 01:53:52,426
Sreelakshmi.

1561
01:53:54,427 --> 01:53:55,394
Get lost, man.

1562
01:53:55,395 --> 01:53:57,529
Kanjyani?

1563
01:53:57,530 --> 01:54:02,377
You vagabond!
Start the vehicle quickly.

1564
01:54:04,070 --> 01:54:06,104
Get lost, dude!

1565
01:54:06,105 --> 01:54:08,106
41.5'

1566
01:54:08,107 --> 01:54:10,409
'Don't come after us please'

1567
01:54:10,410 --> 01:54:11,889
'Allow us to live'.

1568
01:54:18,251 --> 01:54:21,119
'That was last time
Kanjyani brother disappeared'

1569
01:54:21,120 --> 01:54:22,621
'But from then on, he who had...

1570
01:54:22,622 --> 01:54:23,889
...cheated and harassed people...'

1571
01:54:23,890 --> 01:54:27,997
'...occupied the place
of a saint in our lives'

1572
01:54:31,397 --> 01:54:34,299
'I was sure Giri would
now propose me'.

1573
01:54:34,300 --> 01:54:37,440
'I was sure, the sun
would rise that midnight'

1574
01:54:41,241 --> 01:54:43,243
Come, I'll drop you in home.

1575
01:55:07,333 --> 01:55:09,540
Why so late to
get your exam results?

1576
01:55:10,570 --> 01:55:11,536
What happened?

1577
01:55:11,537 --> 01:55:12,481
Didn't you get through?

1578
01:55:16,342 --> 01:55:18,379
It's okay, dear
Don't worry.

1579
01:55:28,554 --> 01:55:33,292
Why don't we proceed Sunny's proposal?

1580
01:55:33,293 --> 01:55:35,967
Let's ask Sunny to come.

1581
01:55:38,298 --> 01:55:40,532
'In the end, just like Julie sister.

1582
01:55:40,533 --> 01:55:44,413
I felt I was destined to marry some idiot'

1583
01:55:46,639 --> 01:55:49,245
'Next day was
an Oshana Sunday'

1584
01:56:01,321 --> 01:56:02,595
Papa, please hold this.

1585
01:56:14,233 --> 01:56:17,146
Pooja, don't forget
what I told you.

1586
01:56:18,237 --> 01:56:21,540
Hear him out fully
and then decide.

1587
01:56:21,541 --> 01:56:25,421
Your parents
have never hurt you.

1588
01:56:26,479 --> 01:56:29,221
Think of them too
before you decide.

1589
01:56:30,216 --> 01:56:31,490
I am with you.

1590
01:56:33,186 --> 01:56:34,028
Go, my dear.

1591
01:56:56,342 --> 01:56:57,476
'Same old place'

1592
01:56:57,477 --> 01:56:59,423
'Only the rainfall is missing'

1593
01:57:22,068 --> 01:57:23,206
You know Pooja.

1594
01:57:24,504 --> 01:57:26,245
I'm an ordinary person.

1595
01:57:27,306 --> 01:57:29,074
A farmer.

1596
01:57:29,075 --> 01:57:30,281
'He has started'

1597
01:57:31,477 --> 01:57:33,145
Now he'll say...

1598
01:57:33,146 --> 01:57:34,746
Pooja you belong
to an affluent family.

1599
01:57:34,747 --> 01:57:37,660
Pooja you belong
to an affluent family.

1600
01:57:39,318 --> 01:57:41,520
You have great heights to reach.

1601
01:57:41,521 --> 01:57:43,467
You have great heights to reach.

1602
01:57:44,524 --> 01:57:46,458
We belong to different worlds.

1603
01:57:46,459 --> 01:57:50,737
We belong to different worlds.

1604
01:57:55,868 --> 01:57:57,245
But...

1605
01:57:58,504 --> 01:58:00,142
...they don't matter to me.

1606
01:59:19,719 --> 01:59:21,686
"Oh God! What's happened to me?

1607
01:59:21,687 --> 01:59:24,489
Lord! I have lost my heart indeed"

1608
01:59:24,490 --> 01:59:27,192
"Oh God! What's happened to me?

1609
01:59:27,193 --> 01:59:29,594
Lord! I have lost my heart indeed"

1610
01:59:29,595 --> 01:59:31,963
"Oh God! What's happened to me?

1611
01:59:31,964 --> 01:59:34,499
Lord! I have lost my heart indeed"

1612
01:59:34,500 --> 01:59:37,335
"Oh God! What's happened to me?

1613
01:59:37,336 --> 01:59:39,704
Lord! I have lost my heart indeed"

1614
01:59:39,705 --> 01:59:44,176
"Into my heart whispering
in this lovable moment."

1615
01:59:44,177 --> 01:59:48,914
"You're my sacred symbol of love, gilded
splendor."

1616
01:59:48,915 --> 01:59:54,831
"oh you!"

1617
01:59:58,624 --> 02:00:02,394
"You're the rainbow colors in me."

1618
02:00:02,395 --> 02:00:05,263
"You're like my honey rain."

1619
02:00:05,264 --> 02:00:07,608
"Oh sweet heart!"

1620
02:00:09,268 --> 02:00:12,003
"I'll come as your shadow."

1621

1623
02:00:24,884 --> 02:00:29,884
"But apple of my eyes."

1624

"I've got crazy in your love.."

1628
02:01:07,059 --> 02:01:08,994
"Oh God! What's happened to me?

1629
02:01:08,995 --> 02:01:11,498
Lord! I have lost my heart indeed"

1630
02:01:12,632 --> 02:01:14,399
"Oh God! What's happened to me?

1631
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:16,744
Lord! I have lost my heart indeed"

1632
02:01:37,690 --> 02:01:40,325
Allowing her to practice archery...

1633
02:01:40,326 --> 02:01:41,326
...ride a bike and what not!

1634
02:01:41,327 --> 02:01:42,394
I've seen her now.

1635
02:01:42,395 --> 02:01:46,064
She goes hugging a Hindu boy in public.

1636
02:01:46,065 --> 02:01:48,500
Dude, there must be
a limit to pampering.

1637
02:01:48,501 --> 02:01:49,741
Otherwise this is what you get.

1638
02:01:50,836 --> 02:01:53,544
Has cat delivered
kittens in your mouth?

1639
02:01:54,940 --> 02:01:56,675
Is this why you asked me to come...

1640
02:01:56,676 --> 02:01:59,316
...to Kerala's greenery and warmth?

1641
02:02:02,915 --> 02:02:03,882
I am leaving.

1642
02:02:03,883 --> 02:02:05,617
You sit alone and enjoy this greenery.

1643
02:02:05,618 --> 02:02:07,689
Warmth, my foot!

1644
02:02:14,093 --> 02:02:15,627
Don't worry.

1645
02:02:15,628 --> 02:02:16,928
Worry?

1646
02:02:16,929 --> 02:02:19,698
I am not at all worried.

1647
02:02:19,699 --> 02:02:21,666
I knew long back she wouldn't...

1648
02:02:21,667 --> 02:02:23,968
...agree to an arranged marriage.

1649
02:02:23,969 --> 02:02:26,805
She is Pooja, my daughter.

1650
02:02:26,806 --> 02:02:29,708
Destined for a love marriage.

1651
02:02:29,709 --> 02:02:34,709
And Giri
He will never elope.

1652
02:02:34,947 --> 02:02:36,681
He is very decent.

1653
02:02:36,682 --> 02:02:39,526
Just watch, they will be here soon.

1654
02:02:48,127 --> 02:02:49,629
What do you say now?

1655
02:02:59,905 --> 02:03:02,707
Doctor, I want
to speak to you.

1656
02:03:02,708 --> 02:03:05,450
You want to marry
my daughter, right?

1657
02:03:06,412 --> 02:03:08,483
Go ahead.

1658
02:03:09,882 --> 02:03:11,683
Don't bungle it
with explanations.

1659
02:03:11,684 --> 02:03:13,891
How is that possible?
He is a Hindu.

1660
02:03:14,620 --> 02:03:17,922
Did Jesus bear the cross
only for Christians?

1661
02:03:17,923 --> 02:03:18,594
Did he not?

1662
02:03:19,558 --> 02:03:22,767
Which century are you still living in?

1663
02:03:23,929 --> 02:03:24,873
Come in, both of you.

1664
02:03:38,577 --> 02:03:39,783
Come.
